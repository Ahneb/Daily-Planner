## About

This is a schedular Webpage that has the functionality to save information at different hour intervals of the day based on the local time. As the hour bracket for the day passes, the time slot is then greyed out to signify that the time has past. The current time slot is highlighted in green and future time slots are highlighted in red.

Also information is saved into local storage and there is a clear button to remove all data for when the new day comes or if there is a need to clear the sheduler. There is also a date posted at the top so that its easy to keep track of what day it is.
